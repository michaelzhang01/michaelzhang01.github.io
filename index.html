			<p>
				Michael Zhang is currently an assistant professor since January 2021 in the <a href="https://saasweb.hku.hk/">Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science</a> at the University of Hong Kong. His research interests include statistical machine learning, scalable inference and Bayesian non-parametrics. Michael Zhang was a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University under the supervision of Profs. <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/">Barbara Engelhardt</a> and <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/bstewart/home">Brandon Stewart</a> and earned a Ph.D. in statistics at the University of Texas at Austin where he was advised by Prof. <a href="http://sinead.github.io/">Sinead Williamson</a>.
